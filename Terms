Implementation: The code the a developer authors to realize
the sequence of steps that the
code runs to solve a problem (called an algorithm).

Refactor: To refactor means to re-write an implementation.
[Refactoring](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DefinitionOfRefactoring.html) aims to increase the code quality
without changing its observable behavior.
Developers refactor code to increase readability, increase flexibility, add a fix for edge-case bugs, reduce duplication,
or make the code more accessible
for yourself and other developers moving forward.

Unit (of code): An individual piece of functionality which is single, whole,
and complete but which also forms an individual component of a larger or more complex whole.

Unit Test: Unit tests are automated tests that test the accuracy, reliability, and appropriateness of
the implementation for a unit of functionality. Unit tests compare the expected vs. actual outputs for
user-defined functions when provided various inputs.

Test Driven Development, or TDD: The practice of writing tests for functionality before writing the implementation of that functionality.
Rather than authoring tests after the functionality exists, the TDD workflow aims to use the automated tests to provide feedback before and
as the developer authors their implementation
